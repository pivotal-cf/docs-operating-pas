title: Identifying TAS for VMs jobs using vCenter

To effectively monitor, control, and manage the virtual machines making up your <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> deployment, you might have to identify which VM corresponds to a particular job in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. You can find the CID of a particular VM from <%= vars.ops_manager %> by navigating to the **Status** tab in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

If you have deployed <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to VMware vSphere, you can also identify which <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> job corresponds to which VM using the vCenter vSphere client.

The CID shown in <%= vars.ops_manager %> is the name of the machine in vCenter.
