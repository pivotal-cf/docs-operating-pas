Cloud Controller. Find your Cloud Controller API endpoint by consulting your cloud operator, from the Apps Manager, or from the
command line.

Log in to the Apps Manager for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> instance, then click **Tools** in the navigation panel.
The **Getting Started** section of the Tools page shows your API endpoint.
