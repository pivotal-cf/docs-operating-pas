This topic describes how to change the domain of an existing <%= vars.platform_name %> installation.

To change the domain of an existing <%= vars.platform_name %> installation:

1. Go to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) tile.

1. Select **Domains** to see the current **Apps domain** for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment.

	![alt-text="The current App domain for your deployment."](./images/switching_domains/er17-switchdomains-before.png)

2. In the terminal, run:

    ```console
    cf login -a API-ENDPOINT
    ```

    Where `API-ENDPOINT` is the API endpoint for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> instance.
    <br>
    The cf CLI prompts you for your <%= vars.platform_name %> username and password, and the org and space you want to access. If you do not know your API endpoint, see [Identifying the API Endpoint for Your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Instance](../operating/api-endpoint.html).

3. To view the domains in the space, run:

    ```console
    cf domains
    ```

    The command returns output similar to the following example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf domains
    Getting domains in your-org as admin...

    name                  status
    yourapps.yourdomain.com   shared
    </pre>

    If you have more than one shared domain, ensure that the domain you want to change is at the top of the list before you apply the new domain to your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile configuration. You can delete and recreate the other shared domains as necessary to push the domain you want to change to the top of the list. If you do this, make sure to map the routes again for each domain.

    The status column is named availability.
        The table refers to private domains with private instead of own.
        For more information, see [Configuring Routes and Domains](../devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html).

4. To confirm that your apps are assigned to the domain you plan to change, run:

    ```console
    cf routes
    ```

    The command returns output similar to the following example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf routes
    Getting routes as admin ...

    space      host    domain                apps
    your-space yourapp yourapps.yourdomain.com yourapp
    </pre>

5. To create the new domain you want to use, run:

    ```console
    cf create-shared-domain NEW-DOMAIN
    ```

    Where `NEW-DOMAIN` is the name you give the new domain.
    <br>
    The command returns output similar to the following example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf create-shared-domain newapps.yourdomain.com

    Creating shared domain newapps.yourdomain.com as admin...
    OK
    </pre>

6. To map the new domain to your app, run:

    ```
    cf map-route APP-NAME NEW-DOMAIN -n HOST-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the name of the app you want to map to the new domain.</li>
      <li><code>NEW-DOMAIN</code> is the domain to which you want to map your app.</li>
      <li><code>HOST-NAME</code> is the hostname of the URL for the route you are mapping.</li>
    </ul>
    Note: When you map a TCP route to an app, a random port is assigned to the route by default.
    To specify a port for a TCP route, use the --port flag.

    The command returns output similar to the following example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf map-route yourapp newapps.yourdomain.com -n yourapp

    Creating route yourapp.newapps.yourdomain.com for org your-org / space your-space as admin...
    OK
    Adding route yourapp.newapps.yourdomain.com to app yourapp in org your-org / space your-space as admin...
    OK
    </pre>

    In this example, both the `APP-NAME` and `HOST-NAME` arguments are `yourapp`, because this is both the name of the app to which you are mapping a route and the intended hostname for the URL.

7. Repeat the previous step for each app in this space. Then check Apps Manager to confirm that the route URL has updated correctly for each app.

    ![alt-text="Apps Manager space shows an application status at 100%."](./images/switching_domains/new_domain_confirmed1.png)

8. Repeat the previous steps for each space in your <%= vars.platform_name %> installation except for the System org, beginning with logging into the org and space and ending with confirming the URL update.
	<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Ordinarily the System org contains only <%= vars.platform_name %> apps that perform utility functions for your installation. <%= vars.company_name %> does not recommend pushing apps to this org. However, if you have pushed apps to the System org, you must also repeat the previous steps for these apps.</p>

9. Once you confirm that every app in every space has been mapped to the new domain, delete the old domain by running:

    ```console
    cf delete-shared-domain OLD-DOMAIN
    ```

    Where `OLD-DOMAIN` is the old domain to delete.
    <br>
    The command returns output similar to the following example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf delete-shared-domain yourapps.yourdomain.com
    Deleting domain yourapps.yourdomain.com as admin...

    This domain is shared across all orgs.
    Deleting it removes all associated routes, and makes any app with this domain unreachable.
    Are you sure you want to delete the domain yourapps.yourdomain.com?
    </pre>

    When prompted, type `yes` to confirm that you want to delete the domain.

10. In the **Domains** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, enter the new domain in the **Apps domain** field. This configures <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to use the new domain.

    ![alt-text="The Domains pane shows System and Apps domain example text."](./images/switching_domains/er17-switchdomains-after.png)

11. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

12. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

13. Click **Apply Changes**. Any apps you push after this update finishes use this new domain.
