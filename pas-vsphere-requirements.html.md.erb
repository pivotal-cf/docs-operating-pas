Here are the requirements for installing <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> on vSphere.
For general resource requirements, see [<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> resource requirements](./requirements.html).

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title">Important</span>
Some versions of <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> are not compatible with vSphere 8.0.3. See the <%= vars.ops_manager %> <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/release-notes.html">v3.0 release notes</a> or <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/2.10/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/release-notes.html">v2.10 release notes</a>.

## <a id='vsphere-reqs'></a> vSphere requirements

The following are requirements for installing <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> that are specific to vSphere.

### <a id='pcf-deployment'></a> Minimum resource Requirements for <%= vars.platform_name %> Deployment with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>

The following are the minimum resource requirements for maintaining a [<%= vars.platform_name %>](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/ops-manager) deployment with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere:

* Disk space: 2&nbsp;TB recommended
* Memory: 120&nbsp;GB
* Two public IP addresses: One for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and one for <%= vars.ops_manager %>
* vCPU cores: 82
* Overall CPU: 28&nbsp;GHz
* vSphere editions: Enterprise Plus or Platinum. These editions include Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS), which is required by <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
* <%= vars.ops_manager %> must have HTTPS access to vCenter and ESX hosts on TCP port 443.
* A configured vSphere cluster:
  * If you enable vSphere DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) for the cluster, you must set the Automation level to **Partially automated** or **Fully automated**. If you set the Automation level to **Manual**, the BOSH automated installation will fail with a `power_on_vm` error when BOSH attempts to create virtual machines (VMs).
  * Deactivate hardware virtualization if your vSphere hosts do not support VT-X/EPT. If you are unsure whether the VM hosts support VT-x/EPT, you can deactivate this setting. If you leave this setting enabled and the VM hosts do not support VT-x/EPT, then each VM requires manual intervention in vCenter to continue powering on without the Intel virtualized VT-x/EPT. See the vCenter help topic at [Setting Virtual Processors and Memory](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Fusion/13/com.vmware.fusion.using.doc/GUID-065E8496-4320-4A54-B1B8-F40C84CA8DAF.html) for more information.
* If you configure an external load balancer, an HTTP keep alive connection timeout greater than five seconds.

<span class="note__title">Note</span>
If you are deploying <%= vars.platform_name %> behind a
firewall, see <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-config_firewall.html">Preparing your firewall for deploying <%= vars.platform_name %></a>.</p>

### <a id='small-footprint-deployment'></a> Minimum resource requirements for <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment with Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>

The following are the minimum resource requirements for maintaining a <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment with Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere:

* 1 vSphere cluster/1 AZ
* 2 resource pools: 1 for NSX-T components and 1 for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> or <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>
* 3 hosts minimum for vSphere HA (4 hosts for vSphere VSAN)
* Shared storage (Such as iSCSI, NFS, and VSAN)
* 1 NSX Manager
* 3 NSX controllers
* 4 large edge VMs in a cluster
* <%= vars.platform_name %>: <%= vars.ops_manager %>, the BOSH Director, and Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>

### <a id='instance-number-scaling-reqs'></a> Instance number and scaling requirements

By default, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deploys the number of VM instances required to run a highly
available configuration of <%= vars.platform_name %>. If you are deploying a test or
sandbox <%= vars.platform_name %> that does not require HA, then you can scale down the number of
instances in your deployment.

For information about the number of instances required to run a minimal, non HA <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment, see [Scaling <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](../operating/scaling-ert-components.html).
