## <a id='admin'></a> Log In as Admin User

To log in to Apps Manager as the Admin user:

1. If you do not know the system domain for the deployment, select the **Domains** pane in the <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> tile and see the value configured in the **System domain** field.

1. Open a browser and go to `apps.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`, where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the system domain you retrieved in the previous step. For example, if the system domain is `system.example.com`, then point your browser to `apps.system.example.com`.

1. Log in using UAA credentials for the Admin user. To obtain these credentials:
	1. In the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, select the **Credentials** tab.
	1. In **UAA**, go to  **Admin Credentials**.
	2. Click **Link to Credential** in the row showing the credentials you want to see.
