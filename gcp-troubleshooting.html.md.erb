You can troubleshoot known issues when deploying <%= vars.platform_name %> on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).


## <a id='sso'></a> Problems connecting with single sign-on (SSO) for VMware Tanzu

You might be unable to connect to applications running on <%= vars.platform_name %> using SSO for VMware Tanzu.

### Explanation

SSO for VMware Tanzu does not support multi-subnets.

### Solution

Ensure that you have configured only one subnet. See [Preparing to deploy Tanzu Operations Manager on GCP](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/gcp-prepare-env-manual.html).

## <a id='ert-install'></a> Uploading <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile causes <%= vars.platform_name %> rails application crash

Uploading the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) tile causes the <%= vars.platform_name %> Rails application to crash.

### Explanation

In compressed format, the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile is 5&nbsp;GB in size. However, when uncompressed during installation, the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile requires additional disk space that can exhaust the space allocated to the boot disk.

### Solution

Ensure that the boot disk is allocated at least 50&nbsp;GB of space. See [Create the <%= vars.platform_name %> VM Instance](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/gcp-deploy-manual.html#start-vm) in _Deploying Tanzu Operations Manager on GCP_.

## <a id="mysql_rep_canary"></a> <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment fails - MySQL Monitor replication-canary job

During installation of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, the replication-canary job fails to start. The error reported in the installation log resembles the following:

<pre class="terminal">
Started updating job mysql_monitor > mysql_monitor/0
(48e7ec82-3cdf-41af-9d0f-90d1f12683c8) (canary). Failed: 'mysql_monitor/0
(48e7ec82-3cdf-41af-9d0f-90d1f12683c8)' is not running after update.
Review logs for failed jobs: replication-canary (00:05:13)

Error 400007: 'mysql_monitor/0 (48e7ec82-3cdf-41af-9d0f-90d1f12683c8)'
is not running after update.
Review logs for failed jobs: replication-canary
</pre>

### Explanation

This error can appear as a result of incorrect configuration of network traffic and missed communication between the Gorouter and a load balancer.

### Solution

1. Make sure you have selected the **Forward SSL to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Router** option in your [<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Network Configuration]config-networking.html#networking).

2. Verify that you have configured the firewall rules properly and that TCP ports `80`, `443`, `2222`, and `8080` are accessible on your GCP load balancers. See [Create Firewall Rules for the Network](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/gcp-deploy-manual.html) in _Preparing to deploy Tanzu Operations Manager on GCP_.

3. Verify that you have configured the proper SSL certificates on your HTTP(S) load balancer in GCP. See [Create HTTP load balancer](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/gcp-prepare-env-manual.html#loadbalancer) in _Preparing to deploy Tanzu Operations Manager on GCP_.

4. If necessary, upload a new certificate again and update any required SSL Certificate and SSH Key fields in your [<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Network Configuration](config-networking.html#networking).

## <a id="database-permissions"></a> Insufficient external database permissions

Upgrade issues can be caused when the external database user used for the network policy DB is given insufficient permissions.
To avoid this upgrade issue, ensure that the networkpolicyserver database user has the `ALL PRIVILEGES` permission.
