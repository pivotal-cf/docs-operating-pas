title: Installing Isolation Segment
owner: RelEng
deployment: IST
---

Use these instructions to install the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile, which allows you to isolate deployment workloads into dedicated resource pools called _isolation segments_.

Installing the tile installs a single isolation segment. However, you can install multiple isolation segments using the Replicator tool shown in [Step 4](#copy).

After you install the tile, you must follow the procedure in [Register an Isolation Segment](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html#register-an-is) in _Managing Isolation Segments_ to create the isolation segment in the Cloud Controller database (CCDB). The topic also includes information about managing an isolation segment.

For more information about how isolation segments work, see [Isolation Segments](../concepts/security.html#isolation-segments) in _<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Security_.

## <a id='routing'></a> Step 1: Configure routing (Optional)

By default, the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) Gorouter handles traffic for your isolation segment. However, you can deploy a dedicated Gorouter for your isolation segment instead. For information about configuring and managing routing for isolation segments, see [Routing for Isolation Segments](../adminguide/routing-is.html).

To deploy a dedicated Gorouter:

1. Add a load balancer in front of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Gorouter. The steps to do this depend on your IaaS, but the setup of the load balancer must mirror the setup of the load balancer for the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Gorouter that you configured in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Create a wildcard DNS entry for traffic routed to any app in the isolation segment. For example, `*.iso.example.com`.

1. Attach the wildcard DNS entry to the load balancer you created.

## <a id='install'></a> Step 2: Install the tile

To install the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile:

1. Download the product file from the [<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/isolation-segment) page of <%= vars.product_network %>.

1. Go to your <%= vars.ops_manager %> URL in a browser to log in to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Import a Product** and select the downloaded product file.

1. Under **<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>** in the left column, click the **+** icon.

## <a id='config'></a> Step 3: Configure the tile

Click the orange **<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>** tile to start the configuration process.

### <a id='az_networks'></a> Assign AZs and networks

In the **Assign AZ and Networks** pane, you assign jobs to your Availability Zones (AZs) and networks.

To configure the **Assign AZ and Networks** pane:

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Select an AZ for your singleton jobs, and one or more AZs to balance other jobs in.

1. Select a network. This network does not need to be the same network where you deployed <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. For most deployments, operators can create unique networks in which to deploy the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile. These networks can maintain network reach with the Diego components because the Diego Cells can reach the Diego Brain and Diego Database VMs.

1. Click **Save**.

<%= partial "/pcf/core/networking-is" %>

### <a id='application_containers'></a> Configure app containers

In the **App Containers** pane, you enable microservice frameworks, private Docker registries, and other services that support your apps at the container level.

To configure the **App Containers** pane:

1. Select **App Containers**.

1. (Optional) To give apps that generally stay within their CPU entitlements priority access to extra CPU during CPU bursts, activate the **Allow CPU burst optimization** check box. This check box is activated by default. When this check box is activated, apps that generally stay within their CPU entitlements have higher-priority access to extra CPU than apps that generally exceed their CPU entitlements. When this check box is deactivated, all apps have equal access to extra CPU during CPU bursts. Whether you activate or deactivate this check box, all apps are always guaranteed the amount of CPU that is within their CPU entitlements.

1. Choose how the Gorouter verifies app identity to activate encryption and prevent misrouting under **Gorouter app identity verification**:
    * **The Gorouter uses TLS to verify app identity**: Activates the Gorouter to verify app identity using TLS. This is the default option.
    * **The Gorouter and apps use mutual TLS to verify each other's identity**: Activates your apps and the Gorouter to verify each other's identity using mutual TLS (mTLS). This option deactivates TCP routing because app containers accept incoming communication only from the Gorouter.

    For more information, see [Preventing Misrouting](../concepts/http-routing.html#consistency) in _HTTP Routing_.

2. (Optional) You can configure <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to run app instances in Docker containers by provided a comma-separated list of their IP address ranges in the **Docker registry allow list** field. For more information, see [Using Docker Registries](../operating/docker-registry.html).

3. Select your preference for disk cleanup scheduling. If you choose **Clean up disk space once usage fills disk**, enter a value in MB for **Reserved disk space for other jobs**. This is the amount of space the garbage collection algorithm must keep free for other jobs. For more information about the configuration options and how to configure a reserved amount, see [Configuring Diego Cell Disk Cleanup Scheduling](../operating/config-cell-cleanup.html).

4. The **Allow containerd delegation** check box governs whether or not Garden delegates containers create and destroy operations to the containerd tool. By default, this option is activated and Garden uses containerd. Deactivate this option by deselecting the check box. For more information about the containerd tool, see [containerd](https://containerd.io).

5. Under **NFSv3 volume services**, select **Allow** or **Do not allow**. NFS volume services allow app developers to bind existing NFS volumes to their apps for shared file access. For more information, see [Enabling Volume Services](../operating/enable-vol-services.html).

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title">Important</span> In a fresh installation, NFSv3 volume services are activated by default. In an upgrade, NFSv3 volume services is set to the same
setting as it was in the previous deployment.</p>

8. (Optional) To configure LDAP for NFSv3 volume services:

* For **LDAP service account user**, enter the user name of the service account in LDAP that manages volume services.
* For **LDAP service account password**, enter the password for the service account.
* For **LDAP server host**, enter the hostname or IP address of the LDAP server.
* For **LDAP server port**, enter the LDAP server port number. The default port is 389.
* For **LDAP user search base**, enter the location in the LDAP directory tree from which any LDAP user search begins. The typical LDAP search base matches your domain name. <br>For example, a domain named `cloud.example.com` typically uses the following LDAP user search base: `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`.
* (Optional) For **LDAP server CA certificate**, you can enter a certificate if your LDAP server supports TLS and you want to enable TLS connections from the NFS driver to your LDAP server. This is the CA certificate that your LDAP server uses to verify the TLS certificates for NFS. Paste in the root certificate from your CA certificate or your self-signed certificate.

  <p class="note important">
<span class="note__title">Important</span>  UAA can only parse one certificate entered into this field. If you enter multiple certificates, UAA only uses the first one you entered and ignores the rest. You only need to include one root certificate or self-signed certificate
</p>

9. Click **Save**.

### <a id='syslog'></a> Configure system logging

In the **System Logging** pane, you can configure system logging in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to forward log messages from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> component VMs to an external service. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends forwarding logs to an external service for use in troubleshooting. If you do not fill these fields, platform logs are not forwarded but remain available on the component VMs and for download through <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

To configure the **System Logging** pane:

1. Select **System Logging**.

1. Select an option under **Configure syslog for system components?**. Do not use** is selected by default. This setting only affects Diego Cell and Gorouter components within the isolation segment. This setting does not affect shared <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> system components.

1. To use syslog, select **Use**.

1. Enter the address of your external syslog aggregation service in the **Syslog server address** field. The address can be a hostname or IP address.

1. Enter a port number in the **Syslog server port** field.

1. Select a protocol from the **Transport protocol** menu. This is the protocol the system uses to transmit logs to syslog.

1. (Optional) To transmit logs over TLS, select the **Enable TLS** check box.

1. Enter a **Permitted peer**. This is the SHA1 fingerprint of the remote peer.

1. Paste the certificate for your TLS certificate authority (CA) in the **TLS CA certificate** field.

1. (Optional) Activate the **Use TCP for file forwarding local transport** check box to transmit logs over TCP. This prevents log truncation, but might cause performance issues.

1. (Optional) The **Do not forward debug logs** check box is activated by default. To forward `DEBUG` syslog messages to an external service, deactivate the check box.

  <p> Some <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> components generate a high volume of <code>DEBUG</code> syslog messages. Activating the <strong>Do not forward debug logs</strong> check box prevents <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> components from forwarding the <code>DEBUG</code> syslog messages to external services. However, <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> still writes the messages to the local disk.</p>

1. (Optional) To specify a custom syslog rule, enter it in the **Custom rsyslog configuration** field in RainerScript syntax. For more information about customizing syslog rules, see [Customizing Syslog Rules](./custom-syslog-rules.html).
For more information about RainerScript, see the [RainerScript](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/rainerscript/index.html) documentation.

1. Select the **Enable system metrics** check box to emit system-level metrics about all VMs in the deployment. For a list of the VM metrics that the System Metric Agent emits, see [VM Metrics](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/system-metrics-release/blob/main/docs/system-metrics-agent.md) in GitHub. When you activate this check box, ensure that you open port `9100` for the isolation segment. For more information, see [Configure Firewall Rules](../adminguide/routing-is.html#config-firewall) in _Routing for Isolation Segments_.

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id='compute-networking-isolation'></a> Configure compute and networking Isolation

In the **Compute and Networking Isolation** pane, you can activate or deactivate
compute isolation and configure Gorouter sharding for isolation segments.

Compute isolation is when an app runs on compute resources, such as clusters,
resource pools, and servers, that are isolated from other resources by a
network partition or firewall.

Networking isolation, or Gorouter sharding, is when traffic to an app instance
uses a dedicated route that is isolated from routes used by other app instances
by a network partition or firewall rule.

In the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile, you cannot deactivate compute
isolation and activate networking isolation at the same time. This is because
networking isolation configures the route by which traffic goes to the
<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile. Both compute and networking isolation
are activated by default.

#### <a id='compute-networking-isolation-configs'></a> Options for configuring compute and networking isolation

The following table describes the ways <%= vars.company_name %>
recommends configuring the **Compute and Networking Isolation** pane and the
**Requests to isolation segments** property in the **Networking**
pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile:

| Use case | Compute isolation | Gorouter sharding mode | Requests to isolation segments | Other requirements | Scaling recommendations |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Use compute isolation and network isolation | Enabled | Isolation segment only | Reject requests for all isolation segments | <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> has its own load balancer and uses a different domain from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> | Apps in the isolation segment can have their own Diego Cells and Gorouters. |
| Use compute isolation and extra <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> Gorouters | Enabled | Isolation segment only | Accept requests for all isolation segments | <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> has its own load balancer and uses the same domain as <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> | Apps in the isolation segment can have their own Diego Cells and Gorouters. |
| Use compute isolation only | Enabled | No isolation segment | Accept requests for all isolation segments | <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> uses <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> load balancer and domain | Scale <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> Gorouters to 0. |
| Use network isolation in some cases | See other rows for guidance | See other rows for guidance | Accept requests for some isolation segments | See other rows for guidance | See other rows for guidance |

The use cases from the previous table are described here:

* **Use compute isolation and network isolation for all isolation segments**:
  This is the most common case. For this use case, select **Reject requests for all isolation segments** for the
  **Requests to isolation segments** radio button in the **Networking**
  pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. This configuration routes
  traffic between an isolation segment and a block of compute resources that is
  dedicated solely to that isolation segment. It also ensures that no traffic is
  routed through the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Gorouters.

* **Use compute isolation and extra <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> Gorouters**:
  To configure traffic for your isolated apps to pass through the
  Gorouters for both <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> and
  <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, activate compute isolation and networking isolation,
  and select **Accept requests for all isolation segments** for the **Requests to isolation segments**
  radio button in the **Networking** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. You can
  also use either the same apps domain you configured in the **Domains** pane
  of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, or a different domain that you
  configure with the DNS for the load balancer for the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>
  Gorouters. This configuration is useful if you want to configure isolated
  compute resources for your apps but do not have additional networking
  restrictions.

* **Use compute isolation only**: To configure the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
  load balancer and apps domain route requests from your isolated apps, you can
  activate compute isolation, deactivate networking isolation, and select **Accept requests for all isolation segments**
  for **Requests to isolation segments** in
  the **Networking** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. This
  configuration allows you to move Diego Cells out of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
  and into isolation segments, so you can upgrade <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
  first and your <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tiles as time permits. This
  allows you to upgrade a large foundation in pieces,
  making it easier to upgrade within scheduled maintenance windows. This
  configuration is useful if your foundation has additional compute resource
  blocks, but no additional Gorouters for <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>
  configured in the **Resource Config** pane.

* **Use network isolation in some cases**:
  For this use case, in **Requests to isolation segments** (**Networking** pane), select **Accept requests for some isolation segments**
  <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. Then provide a comma-separated list of
  <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> names that Gorouters accept traffic
  to. See other cases for guidance on how to configure each
  <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>.
<strong>Compute and Networking Isolation</strong> pane and
<strong>Requests to isolation segments</strong> setting in
the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile in a manner other than the use cases
described here, the smoke tests fail. To deploy the tile anyway, you must
deactivate the Smoke Test errand in the <strong>Errands</strong> pane of the <%=
vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. <%= vars.company_name %> does not recommend
deactivating smoke tests. To configure the Smoke Test errand, see <a
href="#errands">Configure Errands</a>.</p>

#### <a id='pane-config'></a> Configure compute and networking isolation pane

To configure the **Compute and Networking Isolation** pane:

1. Select **Compute and Networking Isolation**.

1. Under **Compute isolation**, activate or deactivate compute isolation:

* To deactivate compute isolation, select **Do not allow**. Select this option if you do not require compute isolation and you are deploying the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile for the purpose of making upgrades more manageable. For example, if you have a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile with a large volume of Diego Cells. This approach helps separate the upgrade of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> control plane from the upgrade of the Diego Cells. Further, it splits the upgrade of the Diego Cells into smaller groups.
* To activate compute isolation, select **Allow** and enter a placement tag for your Diego Cells in the **Segment name** field. This placement tag identifies the Diego Cells that run in your isolation segment and must be unique across your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment. You use this placement tag when following the steps in [Register an Isolation Segment](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html#register-an-is) in _Managing Isolation Segments_ to create the isolation segment in the CCDB.

 If you deactivate compute isolation, you must set <strong>Gorouter sharding mode</strong> to <strong>No isolation segment</strong>. Otherwise, the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile fails to schedule the apps in your isolation segment.

1. Under **Networking isolation**, activate or deactivate networking isolation by selecting a sharding mode. For more information, see [Sharding Gorouters for Isolation Segments](../adminguide/routing-is.html#sharding-routers-isolation-segment) in _Routing for Isolation Segments_.

* **Isolation segment only**: The Gorouters for the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile acknowledge requests only for apps deployed within the Diego Cells of the tile. All other requests fail.
* **No isolation segment**: The Gorouters for the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile reject requests for any isolation segment. Choose this option to add a group of Gorouters for the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, such as when you want a private point of entry for the system domain or to configure a
group of Gorouters to receive requests from your corporate intranet.

### <a id='smoke-tests'></a> Configure smoke tests

In the **Smoke Tests** pane, you specify the org and space where smoke tests are run.
In the org and space that you specify, the Smoke Test errand pushes the app to a <%= vars.platform_name %> org.
The app runs basic functionality tests against both the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tiles after an installation or update.

The Smoke Test errand verifies that your deployment can:

* Push, scale, and delete apps

* Create and delete orgs and spaces

The Smoke Test errand is on by default. You can turn off the Smoke Test errand in the **Errands** pane. For more information, see [Configure Errands](#errands).

To configure the **Smoke Tests** pane:

1. Select **Smoke Tests**.

1. (Optional) In **Domain**, enter the name of the apps domain that <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> uses when pushing an app to run smoke tests.

* To configure routing from the isolation segment to either the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> or <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> Gorouters, enter the apps domain you configured in the **Domains** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.
* To configure separate routing for the isolation segment, enter a different apps domain.

1. If you have a shared apps domain, select **A temporary space within the system org**, which creates a temporary space within the system org for running smoke tests and deletes the space afterwards. Otherwise, select **A specified org and space** and complete these fields to configure where <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> pushes an app to run smoke tests:

* For **Org**, enter the org <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> uses when pushing an app to run smoke tests.
* For **Space**, enter the space <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>  uses when pushing an app to run smoke tests.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title">Important</span>  If you configure the
<strong>Compute and Networking Isolation</strong> pane and the
<strong>Requests to isolation segments</strong> property in
the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile in a manner other than the use cases
described in <a href="#compute-networking-isolation-configs">Options for
Configuring Compute and Networking Isolation</a>, the smoke tests fail.
</p>

### <a id='errands'></a> Configure errands

Errands are scripts that <%= vars.ops_manager %> runs automatically when it installs or uninstalls a product, such as a new version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. There are two types of errands: _post-deploy errands_ run after the product is installed, and _pre-delete errands_ run before the product in uninstalled.

By default, <%= vars.ops_manager %> always runs all errands.

In the **Errands** pane, you can select **On** to always run an errand or **Off** to never run it.

For more information about how <%= vars.ops_manager %> manages errands, see [Managing Errands in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-managing_errands.html).

<div> You must deactivate the Smoke Test errand if:
    <ul>
    <li>You configure the <strong>Compute and Networking Isolation</strong> pane and the <strong>Requests to isolation segments</strong> check box in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile in a manner other than the use cases described in <a href="#compute-networking-isolation-configs">Options for Configuring Compute and Networking Isolation</a>. Otherwise, apps fail to schedule in <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>.</li>
    <li>Both the V2 and V1 Firehoses are deactivated in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. Otherwise, the deploy fails.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

### <a id='resources'></a> Configure resources

In the **Resource Config** pane, you must associate load balancers with the VMs in your deployment to activate traffic.

To configure the **Resource Config** pane:

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. If you use a dedicated Gorouter for your isolation segment:

  <p> The configuration settings available in <strong>Resource Config</strong> vary depending on your IaaS.</p>

  If you have the Load Balancers column in your Resource Config pane:

Enter the wildcard DNS entry attached to your load balancer into the Router row under Load Balancers.

If you do not have the Load Balancers column in your Resource Config pane:

1. Go to the Networking pane.
2. Specify Gorouter IPs.
3. Manually attach the IP addresses to your load balancer.

### <a id='after_config'></a> After tile configuration

After you configure the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile:

1. Register the isolation segment in the CCDB by following the procedure in [Register an Isolation Segment](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html#register-an-is) in _Managing Isolation Segments_.
    <p> If you run smoke tests as a post-deploy errand in the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile, the smoke tests check if your isolation segment in registered in the Cloud Controller database (CCDB). If not, the smoke tests register it in the CCDB.
    This eliminates the need to manually register the isolation segment with the <code>cf create-isolation-segment</code> command.
    For more information about running smoke tests, see <a href="#smoke-tests">Configure Smoke Tests</a>.</p>

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** to deploy the tile.

After the tile finishes deploying, see [Managing Isolation Segments](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html) for more information about managing an isolation segment.

## <a id='copy'></a>  Step 4: Copy the tile (optional)

To create multiple isolation segments, you can copy the <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile with the Replicator tool.

To create multiple isolation segments:

1. Download the Replicator tool from the [<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/isolation-segment) page of <%= vars.product_network %>.

1. Go to the directory where you downloaded the Replicator tool.

1. Replicate the tile by running:

    ```
    ./replicator \
          --name "TILE-NAME" \
          --path /PATH/TO/ORIGINAL.pivotal \
          --output /PATH/TO/COPY.pivotal
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>TILE-NAME</code> is a unique name you provide for the new <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile. The name must be ten characters or less and only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and spaces.</li>
      <li><code>/PATH/TO/ORIGINAL.pivotal</code> is the absolute path to the original <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile you downloaded from <%= vars.product_network %>.</li>
      <li><code>/PATH/TO/COPY.pivotal</code> is the absolute path for the copy that the Replicator tool produces.</li>
    </ul>

1. Follow the procedures in this topic using the new `.pivotal` file, starting with [Step 1](#routing).

### <a id='upgrading-replicas'></a> Upgrading replicated tiles

For information about upgrading replicated <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tiles, see [Upgrading Replicated Tiles](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-upgrading-products.html#replica-tiles) in _Upgrading <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and Other <%= vars.platform_name %> Products_.
