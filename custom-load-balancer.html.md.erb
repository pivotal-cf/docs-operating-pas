title: Using your own load balancer
owner: Ops Manager

Here are instructions for using your own load balancer and forwarding traffic to your <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> router IP address.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> includes a tier of reverse proxies that dynamically track the location of app containers and system components, enabling routing of requests to those endpoints even as IPs and ports change.

## <a id='why-lb'></a> Why you need a load balancer

For the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> routers to be horizontally scalable and highly available, a load balancer must be deployed in front of them. The simplest solution is to use a Layer 4 TCP load balancer, provided by your IaaS or IT team, which passes all HTTP and TLS handling to the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> routers. For more information about TLS termination, see [Securing Traffic into <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html). For a description of features supported by the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> routing tier, see [HTTP Routing](../concepts/http-routing.html).

If you have requirements that are not fulfilled by the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> routers alone, you can choose to use your own Layer 7 load balancer provided by your IaaS or IT team.

If you use your own Layer 7 load balancer, it must fulfill the following requirements:

* Provides load balancing to each of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> router IP addresses.

* Supports TLS termination for wildcard hostnames.

* Adds appropriate `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto` HTTP headers to incoming requests.

* Sets an HTTP keepalive connection timeout greater than five seconds.

* (Optional) Supports WebSocket.

The choice to use your own load balancer depends on what features you need out of a load balancer, and whether you want the ability to configure it yourself.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> App logging with Loggregator requires WebSocket. To use another logging service, see <a href="../devguide/services/log-management.html">Streaming App Logs to Log Management Services</a>.</p>

For information about how to install an F5 Local Traffic Manager (LTM) as a load balancer for <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, see [Configuring an F5 Load Balancer for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](f5-lb.html). For more information about F5 LTMs, see the [F5](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) documentation.


## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

To integrate your own load balancer with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, you must ensure:

* WebSocket connections are not blocked for Loggregator functionality.
* The load balancer must be able to reach the Gorouter IP addresses.

Follow this procedure to use your own load balancer.


## <a id='deploy'></a> Step 1: Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation VM

Deploy an <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation VM. For more information, see [Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> on vSphere](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/vsphere-deploy.html).


## <a id='register'></a> Step 2: Register <%= vars.ops_manager %> IP address

In your load balancer, register the IP addresses that you assigned to <%= vars.ops_manager %>.


## <a id='configure'></a> Step 3: Configure <%= vars.ops_manager %> and BOSH Director

Configure <%= vars.ops_manager %> and the BOSH Director as described in [Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/vsphere-config.html), then add <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

Do not click **Install** after adding <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.


## <a id='configure-networking'></a> Step 4: Configure networking

Configure the **Networking** pane in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. Load balancer configuration in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> varies depending on which IaaS you are using for <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For more information, see [Configure Networking](configure-pas.html#networking) in _Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.


## <a id='finalize'></a> Step 5: Finalize changes

To finalize the changes to your deployment:

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Install**.
