<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> supports SSH access into running apps to help troubleshoot apps hosted by a
deployment.

You can configure a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment to allow SSH access to app instances, and configure
load balancing for those app SSH sessions.


## <a id='diego-configuration'></a> Configure <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> SSH access

You can configure <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to activate or deactivate deployment wide SSH access to app instances.
In addition to this deployment wide configuration, Space Managers have SSH access control over their Space, and Space
Developers have SSH access control to their apps. For details about SSH access permissions, see [App SSH Overview](../devguide/deploy-apps/app-ssh-overview.html).

To configure <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> SSH access for app instances:

1. Go to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

2. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

3. Select **App Containers**.

4. Activate or deactivate the **Allow SSH access to app containers** check box.

5. Optionally, select the **Allow SSH when an app is created** check box to activate SSH access for new apps by default in spaces that permit SSH. If you deselect this check box, developers can still activate SSH after pushing their apps by running `cf enable-ssh APP-NAME`, where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app for which they want to enable SSH.


## <a id="ssh-load-balancer-configuration"></a> Configure an SSH load balancer

For IaaSes where load balancing is available as a service, you can provision a load balancer to balance load across SSH proxy instances. Configure this load balancer to forward incoming TCP traffic on port 2222 to a target pool where you deploy `diego_brain` instances.

For AWS, Azure, and GCP IaaSes, you configure SSH load balancers in the **Resource Config** pane. To register SSH proxies with a load balancer:

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. Expand the row for the job that handles SSH requests. This depends on the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> release you are using:
    * **<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>**: Click the icon next to **Diego Brain**.
    * **Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>**: Click the icon next to **Control**.

1. Enter your load balancer name in the **Load Balancers** field.

<%= vars.ops_manager %> supports an API-only `nsx_lbs` field. You can configure load balancers in vSphere using this field.
