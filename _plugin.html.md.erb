The metric `absolute_entitlement` shows an app's CPU usage relative to its
entitlement.

To retrieve `absolute_entitlement` metrics for all instances of an app:

1. Install the CPU Entitlement Plugin from the
[cpu-entitlement-plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cpu-entitlement-plugin)
repository on GitHub.

1. In a terminal window, run:

    ```
    cf cpu-entitlement APP-NAME
    ```
    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app.
    <br>
    <br>
    The above command returns `absolute_entitlement` metrics for all instances of the app, similar to the following example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    Showing CPU usage against entitlement for app dora-example in org example-org / space example-org-staging as dora@example.com ...
    â€‹
         avg usage   curr usage
    &#35;0   1.62%       1.66%
    &#35;1   2.93%       3.09%
    &#35;2   2.51%       2.62%
    </pre>

After you run the `cf cpu-entitlement` command, you see two values: `avg usage`
and `curr usage`. The average usage is used to split the app into two groups,
good and bad. Good apps have an average CPU usage that is below 100% of their
CPU entitlements, and bad apps have an average CPU usage that is over 100% of
their CPU entitlements. In the example above, all values for the average CPU
usage are under 100% of their CPU entitlements.
