Here is a list of the networking and routing security options for your <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> (<%= app_runtime_abbr %>) deployment.


## <a id="secure_traffic"></a> Securing traffic and controlling routes

You can activate and configure a number of customization options to secure traffic in and out of your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment.

* [TLS connections in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Deployments](tls-info.html)
* [Securing traffic into <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](../../adminguide/securing-traffic.html)
* [Providing a certificate for your TLS termination point](../security_config.html)
* [Enabling TCP routing](../../adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html)

## <a id="use_ipsec"></a> Using the IPsec add-On

The IPsec add-on for VMware Tanzu provides additional security to the network layer for each BOSH-deployed virtual machine (VM).

The IPsec add-on secures network traffic within a deployment and provides internal system protection if a malicious actor breaches your firewall.
