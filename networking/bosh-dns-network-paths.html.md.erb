In this topic, you can learn about BOSH DNS internal network communication paths with other <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> components.

For more information about BOSH DNS, see [Native DNS Support](https://bosh.io/docs/dns.html) in the BOSH documentation.

The following table lists network communication paths for BOSH DNS.

<p> Port 8853 is the destination port for communications between BOSH DNS health processes. You must allow TCP traffic on 8853 for all VMs running BOSH DNS.</p>
