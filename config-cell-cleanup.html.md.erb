title: Configuring Diego Cell disk cleanup scheduling

Disk cleanup is the process of removing unused layers from the Diego Cell disk. The disk cleanup process removes all unused Docker image layers and old <%= vars.platform_name %> stacks, regardless of their size or age.

To perform a detailed analysis of disk usage in your <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> deployment, see [Examining GrootFS Disk Usage](../adminguide/examining_grootfs_disk.html).

This article describes how to configure disk cleanup scheduling on Diego Cells in <%= vars.platform_name %>.


## <a id='overview'></a> Why disk cleanup is needed

<%= vars.platform_name %> isolates app instances (AIs) from each other using containers that run inside Diego Cells. Containers enforce a set of isolation layers, including file system isolation. A <%= vars.platform_name %> container file system can either be a <%= vars.platform_name %> stack or the result of pulling a Docker image.

For performance reasons, the Diego Cells cache the Docker image layers and the <%= vars.platform_name %> stacks used by running AIs. When <%= vars.platform_name %> destroys an AI or reschedules an AI to a different Diego Cell, certain Docker image layers or an old <%= vars.platform_name %> stack becomes unused. If <%= vars.platform_name %> does not clean these unused layers, the cell ephemeral disk slowly fills.


## <a id='options'></a> Options for disk cleanup

<%= vars.platform_name %> provides the following options for scheduling the disk cleanup process on Diego Cells in the **App Containers** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile:

* **Never clean up disk space**: <%= vars.company_name %> does not recommend selecting this option for production environments.

* **Routinely clean up disk space**: This option makes the Diego Cell schedule a disk cleanup whenever a container is created. Running the disk cleanup process this frequently can result in a negative impact on the Diego Cell performance.

* **Clean up disk space once usage fills disk**: This option makes the Diego Cell schedule the disk cleanup process only when disk usage encroaches on the space reserved for other jobs.

For more information about these options, see [Configure Disk Cleanup Scheduling](#applying-configuration).

### <a id='recommendations'></a> Recommendations

To select the best option for disk cleanup, you must consider the workload that the Diego Cells run.

For <%= vars.platform_name %> installations that primarily run buildpack-based apps, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends selecting the **Routinely clean up disk space** option. The **Routinely clean up disk space** option ensures that when a new stack becomes available on a cell, the old stack is dropped immediately from the cache; that is, Diego Cells schedule a disk cleanup whenever a container is created.

For <%= vars.platform_name %> installations that primarily run Docker images, or both Docker images and buildpack-based apps, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends selecting the **Clean up disk space once usage fills disk** option.

### <a id='choosing-a-reserve'></a> Calculating a reserve

By default, the space reserved for other jobs is set to a reasonable value for the majority of <%= vars.platform_name %> deployments. The reserve default value accounts for the most typical deployment case where the only other component that writes to `/var/vcap/data` is the Diego executor cache.

However, if you are deploying any BOSH add-ons that require space in the ephemeral disk, you might need to increase the reserve.

For more information on disk usage and garbage collection in GrootFS, see [GrootFS Disk Usage](../concepts/grootfs-disk.html) and [Examining GrootFS Disk Usage](../adminguide/examining_grootfs_disk.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>Caution:</strong> Setting the reserve to an excessive value can cause garbage collection to occur more frequently. An increase in frequency can result in regular slowdowns in performance of apps on particular Diego Cells. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends leaving the default value for the reserve unless you are advised to edit it.

## <a id='applying-configuration'></a> Configure disk cleanup scheduling

1. Go to the <%= vars.platform_name %> Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> tile, and navigate to **App Containers**.

1. Under **Diego Cell disk cleanup scheduling**, select an option.

1. If you select **Clean up disk space once usage fills disk**, you can edit the **Reserved disk space for other jobs** field. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you leave the default value of `15360`&nbsp;MB, or 15&nbsp;GB, in **Reserved disk space for other jobs** unless you are instructed to change it. For more information, see [Calculating a Reserve](#choosing-a-reserve).

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="next"></a> Next steps

If you are configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> for the first time, return to your specific IaaS configuration to continue the installation process.

If you are editing an existing <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> installation, return to the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**, click **Review Pending Changes**, and click **Apply Changes**.
