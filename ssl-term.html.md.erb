title: Configuring SSL termination for Tanzu Operations Manager on vSphere
owner: Ops Manager
---

To use SSL termination in <%= vars.platform_name %>, you must configure your own load balancer.

Production environments must use a highly-available customer-provided load balancing solution that:

* Provides SSL termination with wildcard DNS location
* Provides load balancing to each of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Gorouter IPs
* Adds appropriate `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto` HTTP headers

To use your own load balancer:

1. Register one or more static IP address for <%= vars.platform_name %> with your load balancer.

1. Create an A record in your DNS that points to your load balancer IP address. The A record associates the **System domain** and **Apps domain** that you configure in the **Domains** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile with the IP address of your load balancer.
    <br />
    <br />
    For example, with `<%= vars.platform_name_lc %>.example.com` as the main subdomain for your <%= vars.platform_name %> installation and a load balancer IP address `198.51.100.1`, you must create an A record in your DNS that serves `example.com` and points `*.<%= vars.platform_name_lc %>` to `198.51.100.1`.

    <table class="table">
    <thead>
	<thead><tr>
	<th>Name</th>
	<th>Type</th>
	<th>Data</th>
	<th>Domain</th>
	</tr></thead>
	</thead>
	<tr>
	<td>*.<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr_lc %></td>
	<td>A</td>
	<td>198.51.100.1</td>
	<td>example.com</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

1. Go to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Select **Networking**.

1. In the **Gorouter IPs** field, enter the static IP address for <%= vars.platform_name %> that you have registered with your load balancer.

1. Provide your SSL certificate in the **Certificates and private keys for the Gorouter** fields. For more information, see [Providing a Certificate for Your TLS Termination Point](./security_config.html).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> When adding or removing <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Gorouters, you must update your load balancing solution configuration with the appropriate IP addresses.</p>
