title: TAS for VMs Resource Requirements
owner:
---

The general requirements for deploying and managing an installation
of <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> are:

* A wildcard DNS record that points to your Gorouter or load balancer. Also, you can use a service such as xip.io. For example, `203.0.113.0.xip.io`.
  * <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> gives each app its own hostname in your app domain.
  * With a wildcard DNS record, every hostname in your domain resolves to the IP address of your Gorouter or load balancer, and you do not have to configure an A record for each app hostname. For example, if you create a DNS record `*.example.com` pointing to your load balancer or Gorouter, every app deployed to the `example.com` domain resolves to the IP address of your Gorouter.

* At least one wildcard TLS certificate that matches the DNS record you set up, `*.example.com`.

* Sufficient IP allocation:
  * One static IP address for one of your Gorouters.
  * One static IP address for each job in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. For a full list, see the **Resource Config** pane for each tile.
  * One static IP address for each of the following jobs:
      * Consul
      * NATS
      * File Storage
      * MySQL Proxy
      * MySQL Server
      * Backup Restore Node
      * Router
      * MySQL Monitor
      * Diego Brain
      * TCP Router
  * One IP for each VM instance created by the service.
  * An additional IP address for each compilation worker. The formula for total IPs needed is `IPs needed = static IPs + VM instances + compilation workers`.

    <p> <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you allocate at least 36 dynamic IP addresses when installing <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. BOSH requires additional dynamic IP addresses during installation to compile and deploy VMs, install <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, and connect to services.</p>

* One or more NTP servers if not already provided by your IaaS.

* (**Recommended**) A network without DHCP available for deploying the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> VMs.
  <p> If you have DHCP, see <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Deployment Problems</a> in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> documentation for information about avoiding issues with your installation.</p>

* (**Optional**) External storage. When you deploy <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, you can select internal file storage or external file storage, either network-accessible or IaaS-provided, as an option in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

  <%= vars.company_name %> recommends using external storage whenever possible. For more information about how file storage location affects platform performance and stability during upgrades, see [Configure File Storage](./configuring.html#file-storage) in _Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> for Upgrades_.

* (**Optional**) External databases. When you install <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, you can select internal or external databases for the BOSH Director and for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends using external databases in production deployments. An external database must be configured to use the UTC timezone.

* (**Optional**) External user stores. When you deploy <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, you can select a SAML user store for <%= vars.ops_manager %> or a SAML or LDAP user store for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, to integrate existing user accounts.

* The most recent version of the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) (cf CLI).

## <a id='small-footprint-diffs'></a> Differences in Small Footprint TAS for VMs

You can deploy Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> with a minimum of four VMs, as shown in the following image.

<p class="note">
<span class="note__title">Note</span>
The following image assumes that you are using an external blobstore.
</p>

![Small Footprint TAS for VMs has 4 required VMs and 5 optional VMs.](./images/srt-vms.png)

To reduce the number of VMs required for Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, the Control and Database VMs include co-located jobs that run on a single VM in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. See the next sections for details.

For more information about the components mentioned on this page, see [<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Components](../concepts/architecture/index.html).

### <a id='controlvm'></a> Control VM

The Control VM includes the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> jobs that handle management plane operations, app life cycles, logging, and user authorization and authentication. Additionally, all errands run on the Control VM, eliminating the need for a VM for each errand and significantly reducing the time it takes to run errands.

The following image shows all the jobs from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> that are co-located on the Control VM in Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. Small Footprint TAS for VMs co-locates 11 VMs onto 1 VM called Control. The 11 VMs are Cloud Controller, Cloud Controller Worker, Clock Global, Diego BBS, Diego Brain, Doppler Server, Loggregator Traffic Controller, Syslog Adapter, Syslog Scheduler, UAA, and optionally, CredHub.

### <a id='dbvm'></a> Database VM

The Database VM includes the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> jobs that handle internal storage and messaging.

The following image shows all the jobs from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> that are co-located on the Database VM in Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. Small Footprint TAS for VMs Condenses 3 VMs onto 1 VM called Database. The three TAS for VMs VMs are NATS, MySQL Proxy, and MySQL Server. The MySQL Proxy and MySQL Server are optional VMs.

### <a id='computevm'></a> Compute VM

The Compute VM is the same as the Diego Cell VM in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

### <a id='othervms'></a> Other VMs (unchanged)

For the other VMs, they perform the same functions in both versions of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile. The Router, File Storage, Backup Restore Node, MySQL Monitor, and TCP Router VMs are the same in both TAS for VMs and Small Footprint TAS for VMs.

## <a id='instance-number-scaling-reqs'></a> Instance number and scaling requirements

By default, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deploys the number of VM instances required to run a highly available configuration. If you are deploying a test or sandbox <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> that does not require HA, then you can scale down the number of instances in your deployment.

For information about the number of instances required to run a minimal, non-HA <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment, see [Scaling <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](../operating/scaling-ert-components.html).
