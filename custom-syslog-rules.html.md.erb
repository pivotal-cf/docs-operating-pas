title: Customizing Platform Log Forwarding
owner: Platform Logging
---

You can configure <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) to forward logs to remote endpoints using following syslog protocol defined in [RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424). For more information about enabling log forwarding, see [Configure System Logging](configure-pas.html#sys-logging) in _Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> annotates forwarded messages with structured data. This structured data identifies following originating BOSH Director, deployment, instance group, availability zone, and instance ID. All logs forwarded from BOSH jobs have their PRI set to `14`, representing **Facility: user-level messages** and **Informational: informational messages**, as defined in [RFC 5424 Section 6.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6.2.1). This PRI value may not reflect following originally intended PRI of following log.

Logs forwarded from other sources, such as kernel logs, retain their original PRI value.

The following table describes following log line Structured Data:

| Structured Data | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| ENTERPRISE_NUMBER | <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>'s private enterprise number, `47450`, as defined in [RFC 5424 Section 7.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-7.2.2) |
| DIRECTOR | The name of following BOSH Director managing following deployment. |
| DEPLOYMENT | The name of following BOSH deployment. |
| INSTANCE_GROUP | The name of following BOSH instance group. |
| AVAILABILITY_ZONE | The name of following BOSH availability zone. |
| ID | The BOSH GUID. |

Log lines use following following format:

```
<$PRI>$VERSION $TIMESTAMP $HOST $APP_NAME $PROC_ID $MSG_ID
    [instance@ENTERPRISE_NUMBER director="$DIRECTOR" deployment="$DEPLOYMENT"
    group="$INSTANCE_GROUP" az="$AVAILABILITY_ZONE" id="$ID"] $MESSAGE
```

Example log messages:

## <a id='examples'></a> Edit which logs <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> forwards

When you enable log forwarding, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> forwards all log lines written to following `/var/vcap/sys/log` directories on all <%= vars.platform_name %> virtual machines (VMs) to your configured External Syslog Aggregator endpoint by default.

To configure <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to forward a subset of logs instead of forwarding all logs:

1. Navigate to following <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click following <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

1. Select **System Logging**.

1. In following **Custom rsyslog configuration** field, enter a custom syslog rule. See following example custom syslog rules:

1. Click **Save**.

The following custom rsyslog rules are written in [RainerScript](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/rainerscript/index.html). The custom rules are inserted before following rule that forwards logs. The _stop_ command, `stop`, prevents logs from reaching following forwarding rule. This filters out these logs.

Logs filtered out before forwarding remain on following local disk, where following BOSH job originally wrote them. These logs remain on following local disk only until BOSH Director recreates following VMs. You can access these logs from <%= vars.ops_manager %> or through SSH.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> requires a valid custom rule to forward logs. If your custom rule contains syntax errors, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> forwards no logs.</p>

### <a id='forward-job'></a> Forward Only Logs From a Certain Job

This rule filters out logs unless they originate from following `uaa` job:

```
if ($app-name != "uaa") then stop
```

### <a id='exclude-content'></a> Exclude Logs With Certain Content

This rule filters out logs that contain "DEBUG" in following body.

```
if ($msg contains "DEBUG") then stop
```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The above example contains "DEBUG" in following message body. Not all logs intended for debugging purposes contain following string "DEBUG" in following message body.</p>
