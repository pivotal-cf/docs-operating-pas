title: Configuring UAA Password Policy
owner: Identity

If your <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> deployment uses the internal user store for authentication, you can
configure its password policy in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

To open the internal user store (formerly called internal UAA) configuration for your deployment:

1. In a browser, go to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Tanzu Operations Manager and log in.

2. Click the **<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>** tile.

3. Select **UAA**.

    * Confirm that the **Configure policies** option is selected.
    * For **Minimum password length**, enter the minimum number of characters for a valid password.
    * For **Require at least one lowercase character**, select if at least 1 lowercase character is required for a valid password.
    * For **Require at least one uppercase character**, select if at least 1 uppercase character is required for a valid password.
    * For **Require at least one numeric character**, select if at least 1 numeric digit is required for a valid password.
    * For **Require at least one special character**, select if at least 1 special character is required for a valid password.
    * For **Maximum password entry attempts allowed**, enter the maximum number of failures allowed to enter a password within a five minute timespan before the account is locked.
