title: Configuring UAA Password Policy

If your <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> deployment uses the internal user store for authentication, you can configure its password policy in the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.

To open the internal user store (formerly called internal UAA) configuration for your deployment:

1. In a browser, go to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Ops Manager and log in.

2. Click the **<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>** tile.

3. Select **Authentication and Enterprise SSO**. For help configuring these fields, see the **Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO** section of the **Configuring TAS** topic.

1. For **Minimum special characters**, enter the minimum number of special characters required for a valid password.

1. For **Maximum password entry attempts allowed**, enter the maximum number of failures allowed to enter a password within a five-minute timespan before the account is locked.
